# Recap Reports — cli-detection-convention

Per-run recap reports produced by `specstudio:recap`. Each report is named `<sha>.md` where `<sha>` is the abbreviated git SHA of `HEAD` at run time. Each row records which verify report the recap was compared against (`Verify revision`) so reviewers can trace the drift gate end-to-end.

## Contents
